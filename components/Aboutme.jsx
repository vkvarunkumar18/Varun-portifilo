const aboutText = `I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in full-stack development (React.js & Node.js). I am enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience, pixel-perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant code matter to me.
My journey as a web developer began quite recently, back in 2023, and it's already been a period of constant growth and evolution. I've been really eager to tackle new challenges and learn the latest technologies.
I'm a strong progressive thinker and really enjoy seeing projects through from start to finish, from the initial idea to the final development.
One last thing, I'm available for freelance work, so feel free to reach out and say hello! I promise I don't bite ðŸ˜‰`;
